Other notes:
	I switched server from xamp to openserver, because xamp doesnt support sending emails. I did it via smtp of openserver. 
	I changed the password of webhost (you can find it in db.php file), and droped the table (idk why, sometimes it does not work correctly).
	Now sending emails work correctly both localhost and webserver(000webhost).
	This version (16.10.2021) works stable on webserver and localhost, so I name it 1.0 .
	I need to work on design and some features, but now it works stable.

	At the begining the verification code for email verification was generated and sent in form by redirecting itself with action='/', then I changed that logic, and now that process is implemented by Session. That is not the best solution, so I plan to save the  code in encrypted view in database, and then check it with the form's one.

	I had to change the name of signin.php to login.php, cause Google Chrome gave me a privacy security error, when I try to visit ...host.com/signin.php. It fixed by changing filename. I also changed it in every file((
09.11
	I finally fixed issues with sending emails(hope). If it won't work again, take a look of "mail/help.txt" file.
